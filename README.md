# QR code Generator

This is a web application that works by taking user input, generating a QR code using a `QR generator API`, and displaying the QR code on the webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
## üõ† Tools Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- QR generator API



## ‚ùáÔ∏è Getting Started

To run the project, please follow the below steps:

- Clone the project repository to your local machine.
- Open the project folder and locate the `index.html` file.
- Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. You should see a webpage with a `Generate` button along with an input text field.
- Enter the desired input text into the input field and click on the `Generate` button.
- The QR code for the input text will be generated and displayed on the webpage.

That's it! You can now easily generate QR codes using this web application.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works

Here's how the project works:

- The user opens the web application in their web browser by accessing the `index.html` file.
- The web application displays a simple user interface with an input field to enter the desired text and a `Generate` button.
- The user enters the desired text in the input field and clicks on the `Generate` button.
- The web application retrieves the input text using JavaScript and sends an API request to the QR code generator API.
- The QR code generator API receives the input text and generates a QR code image.
- The API sends the QR code image back to the web application as a response to the API request.
The web application receives the QR code image and uses JavaScript to display it on the webpage.
The user can now see the generated QR code on the webpage and can download it if needed.
